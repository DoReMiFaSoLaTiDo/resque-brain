# Contributing

In general:

1. Fork it
2. Make a branch
3. Write Tests
4. Implement/Fix Bug
5. Submit Pull Request.  If you are changing UI, include screenshots or screencasts of the change.

Step 3 is super important, and please do it first.  If you can test via a unit test or via a JavaScript test, that is preferable
to a full-blown integration test.

## General Guidelines

* When in doubt, test it.  If you can't test it, re-think what you are doing
* The UI must be kept focused on *quickly* understanding what's going with Resque.  Anything added to the overview, summary, or
nav has the potential to take away from that.
* Code formatting and internal application architecture must be consistent.  When I've deviated from "The Rails Way", I had a
godo reason.
